				<p>Kevin Henneberger has been working as a Web Production Specialist in Boston for the past four years. His main responsibilities consist of scheduling and posting new content to <a href="http://jsh.christianscience.com" target="_blank"> JSH-Online.com</a>, producing and moderating a weekly live audio chat, and managing the social media presence for JSH-Online.</p>
				<p>Kevin grew up in Dallas, Texas, and went to school at Texas A&amp;M University&mdash;where he earned a degree in Agricultural Communications and Journalism. He met his wife (from California) during an internship (in Boston) in the summer of 2007. They lived in Texas for about a year (where they got married), and made their way back to Boston in the Spring of 2009. They both enjoy Boston and plan to remain there for a few more years.</p>
